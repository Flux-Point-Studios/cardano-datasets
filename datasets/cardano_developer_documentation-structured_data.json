This redirects them to a website where the verification status is displayed. The website forwards the encrypted data to a validation service that decrypts it and uses the encoded information to look for a corresponding NFT on the Cardano blockchain. If a matching NFT is found, its metadata is analyzed and compared to the data stored on the NFC chip, thus verifying the authenticity of the hoodie."

One major drawback is that the verification service is centrally hosted, and the validation of the hoodie's authenticity relies on it. Future improvements include defining a new standard that leverages mechanisms similar to CIP-68 for secure and trustless ownership transfer of the digital asset tied to the physical good. Additionally, using more sophisticated NFC chips with asymmetric key cryptography could enable multi-signature schemes for ownership transfer."
