        "assistant": "It depends. To make a transaction, our implementation currently select UTxO from the available UTxO in the wallet in order to cover for the output requested in a transaction. For every output, the wallet actually creates two outputs: - The actual output to a target address - A change output to a change address of the source wallet Also, in practice, we strive to make these two outputs relatively equivalent in size, such that one cannot easily guess the change output from the actual one by looking at the transaction; enforcing therefore some privacy for users. Incidentally, we do consider every requested output in a transaction as an independent problem. This means that a single UTxO can only cover for one of the output (and will in practice, tend to be twice as big, such that we can generate an equivalent corresponding change output). As a consequence, in order to make a transaction to three target outputs, one needs to have at least three UTxOs that are big enough to cover all three outputs independently. Finally, it's important to notice that the fee calculation runs **after** the coin selection and is divvied across all change outputs. So in practice, the UTxOs only need to independently cover for outputs, but are considered together when adjusting for fees. A few examples to make this more concrete (in the scenario below, fees are ~`180000`): // Both UTxOs can separately cover fee and outputs Available UTxO: [200000, 200000] Payment Distribution: [14, 42] Result: Ok // 2 UTxOs, each cannot separately cover fee and outputs, but jointly can Available UTxO: [100000, 100000] Payment Distribution: [14, 42] Result: Ok // Single UTxOs, big enough to cover for total requested amount & fee, but multiple outputs Available UTxO: [400000] Payment Distribution: [14, 42] Result: Error - UTxO not enough fragmented"

Current hardware requirements for cardano-node are published on cardano-node's [release page](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/releases). For most cases cardano-node's hardware requirements are good enough to cover requirements of running cardano-wallet as well. Here are some general hardware recommendations for running cardano-wallet: - **Processor:** A multicore processor with a clock speed of at least 1.6 GHz or faster is recommended, but a faster processor is better for optimal performance. - **Memory:** A minimum of 4 GB of RAM is recommended, although more is better. - **Storage:** A minimum of 5 GB of free storage for wallet data is recommended. - **Network:** A stable internet connection with at least 5 Mbps upload and download speeds is recommended for syncing the blockchain data and performing transactions. Again, these are general recommendations and the actual hardware requirements may vary depending on factors such as the number and size of wallets being managed and the specific usage patterns of the software. In particular the above requirements are good enough to handle fairly large wallet having **15k addresses** and **15k transactions** in history. Smaller wallets would not require as much resources but larger would require more."
